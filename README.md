# PHP Calculator Application

ðŸŽ‰ Just Built My First PHP Application! ðŸŽ‰

I've just completed a simple calculator using PHP, and while it may be a basic application, the learning experience has been incredibly valuable. Through this project, I've gained a clear understanding of the difference between the GET and POST methods, explored some global constants, and even dabbled with error handling.

This is just the beginning, and I'm excited to dive deeper into PHP and take on more challenging projects. ðŸš€
